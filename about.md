S/V ("[Sailing Vessel](/vessel_vs_yacht/)") Tinarasia is a 1989 "LÃ©gende 36"
aluminium-hull, fiberglass-deck, sloop rigged sailboat built by the Alu
Plaisance boatyard in Aubagne, France based on plans drawn by Philippe
Subrero.

The owners, Tobi and Anna, are a couple from Berlin who share a love for all
sorts of shenanigans on the water and below the water (yes, we're divers,
too).
