since some of our esteemed readers have voiced concerns about the lack of
gravitas in the title of this online journal, namely the fact that we refer
to Tinarasia as a "sailing vessel" (S/V) and not a "sailing yacht" (S/Y),
here's a brief explanation of the difference:

## If you do all the work yourself, it's a vessel.
## If you have paid crew, it's a yacht.

simple as that.
