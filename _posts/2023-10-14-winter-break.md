# "invernaje", as they say in spanish,
is the process of getting everything ship-shape and then leaving the boat
for a few months until the usual end-of-year crazyness is over, the autumn
storms are gone, and the crew is being shanghaied by their elders to fix the
wifi at their homes in return for them hosting the dreaded
end-of-year-festivities.

and so we say goodbye to our new-to-us boat for the next months. which makes
no sense, because it's way nicer and warmer here than back home, especially
in december. but i digress.

anyhow: stay tuned, we'll continue the journey sometime in
march/april with a few weeks of DIY boat fixer-uppery (might contain
glorious sanding...) and maybe even a few days out on the water.
